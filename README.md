## Overview

GitHub Release Detector is an agent-based monitoring system that leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) architecture to create an autonomous pipeline for tracking and notifying users of open-source software releases. The system implements a multi-layered service architecture connecting GitHub's REST API with Gmail's SMTP services through OAuth2 authentication.

- üìß Receive email notifications when new releases are detected
- ü§ñ Includes detailed release notes and changelog information
- ‚è±Ô∏è Configurable checking intervals
- üîÑ Easy setup with GitHub Actions for continuous monitoring

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Node.js 20+
- Gmail account
- Google Cloud Platform OAuth credentials

## Installation

### Local Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GongRzhe/Github-Realease-Detecter.git
   cd Github-Realease-Detecter
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Install the Gmail MCP tool:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @gongrzhe/server-gmail-autoauth-mcp
   ```

4. Set up OAuth credentials:
   - Create a project in [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Enable the Gmail API
   - Create OAuth credentials (Desktop app)
   - Download the credentials as `gcp-oauth.keys.json`

### GitHub Actions Setup

1. Fork this repository
2. Add the following secrets to your repository:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key (if you're using AI features)
   - `REPOS_TO_MONITOR`: Comma-separated list of repos (e.g., owner/repo1 owner/repo2)
   - `RECIPIENT_EMAIL`: Email address to receive notifications
   - `GCP_OAUTH_B64`: Base64-encoded OAuth credentials (see below)
   - `GMAIL_AUTH_B64`: Base64-encoded Gmail credentials (see below)

#### Encoding Secrets for GitHub Actions

In PowerShell:
```powershell
# For OAuth credentials
$fileContent = Get-Content -Path "gcp-oauth.keys.json" -Raw
$encodedContent = [Convert]::ToBase64String([System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes($fileContent))
$encodedContent | Out-File -FilePath "gcp-oauth.keys.json.b64"

# For Gmail credentials (if you have them already)
$fileContent = Get-Content -Path "credentials.json" -Raw
$encodedContent = [Convert]::ToBase64String([System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes($fileContent))
$encodedContent | Out-File -FilePath "credentials.json.b64"
```

## Configuration

Create a configuration file or use environment variables:

```bash
# Example .env file
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-XXX
```

## Usage

### Running Locally

```bash
python github_release_monitor.py --repos owner/repo1 owner/repo2 --email recipient@example.com --interval 60
```

### Using GitHub Actions

The included workflow will run automatically on schedule or can be triggered manually.

To manually trigger the workflow:
1. Go to the Actions tab in your repository
2. Select "GitHub Release Monitor" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"

## How It Works

1. The script periodically checks the GitHub API for new releases in the specified repositories
2. When a new release is detected, it formats an email notification with release details
3. The Gmail MCP tool authenticates with your Gmail account and sends the notification
4. The system keeps track of which releases have already been reported to avoid duplicates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **JSON Parsing Errors**: Ensure your OAuth credentials are properly encoded when using GitHub Actions
2. **Authentication Failures**: Run the tool with `auth` parameter locally first to authenticate:
   ```bash
   npx @gongrzhe/server-gmail-autoauth-mcp auth
   ```
3. **Rate Limiting**: Use a GitHub token to increase API rate limits
